- Find the smallest missing element from a sorted array 
- Find floor and ceil of a number in a sorted integer array
- Search in a nearly sorted array in logarithmic time
- Find the number of 1s in a sorted binary array
- Find the peak element in an array

### Practice-2

- Find sum of all array elements using recursion.
- Create an array ‘a1’ with ‘n’ elements. Insert an element in ith position of ‘a1’ and also delete an element from jth position of ‘a1’.
- Convert uppercase string to lowercase using for loop.
- Find the sum of rows and columns of matrix of given order (row x column).
- Find the product of two matrices using pointers.
- Store ‘n’ numbers (integers or real) in an array. Conduct a linear search for a given number and report success or failure in the form of a suitable message.
- Write a program to reverse an array.
- Find the largest three distinct elements in an array: Input: arr[] = {10, 4, 3, 50, 23, 90} Output: 90, 50, 23
- Move all zeroes to end of array
- Rearrange an array in maximum minimum form using Two Pointer Technique. Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} Output: arr[] = {7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4}.
- Print all Distinct ( Unique ) Elements in given Array: Input: arr[] = {12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45} Output: 12, 10, 9, 2
- Write a program to count the total number of nonzero elements in a two-dimensional array.
- Write a program using pointers to interchange the second biggest and the second smallest number in the array.

### Practice-3

- Implement the activity selection problem to get a clear understanding of greedy approach.
- Get a detailed insight of dynamic programming approach by the implementation of Matrix Chain Multiplication problem and see the impact of parenthesis positioning on time requirements for matrix multiplication.
- Compare the performance of Dijkstra and Bellman ford algorithm for the single source shortest path problem.
- Through 0/1 Knapsack problem, analyze the greedy and dynamic programming approach for the same dataset.
- Implement the sum of subset and N Queen problem.
- Compare the Backtracking and Branch & Bound Approach by the implementation of 0/1 Knapsack problem. Also compare the performance with dynamic programming approach.
